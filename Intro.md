## Architecture of Salesforce
```
Trusted Multitenant Cloud:
Imagine you have a big building with many apartments. Each apartment is like a separate house, but they all share the same building. In Salesforce, the building is like a big computer, and each apartment is like a different company using Salesforce. They all share the same computer, but their information is kept separate and safe from each other.
Scalable Metadata Platform:
Think of this like a magical Lego set. You can build anything you want with it, like a spaceship or a castle. In Salesforce, this platform helps businesses customize and expand their Salesforce system easily, whether they have a little bit of data or a lot, or whether they have a few users or many.
Enterprise Ecosystem:
Imagine you're part of a big team working together on a project. In Salesforce, there are many companies and partners working together to make Salesforce even better. They create and maintain different apps and tools that make Salesforce more useful for everyone.
CRM and Related Functionality:
CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management, which is like keeping track of all your friends and everything you do together. In Salesforce, it's like having a special tool that helps businesses keep track of all their customers and everything they do together, like making sales, sending emails, and solving problems. It also helps businesses create cool apps and analyze data to make better decisions.
APIs:
APIs are like magical doors that let different programs talk to each other and share information. In Salesforce, these APIs are like secret passages that help developers create cool new features and connect Salesforce to other programs, like making a special app for your phone that helps you do your homework better.

```

## Service Cloud
```
Focus: This part of Salesforce is all about helping and supporting customers.
Unique Approach: It provides faster, individualized assistance and takes proactive steps to solve issues.
Impact: By enhancing the customer experience and building loyalty, it contributes to increased sales and business success.

Business goals:
1.Personalized Service − Give each customer a good service experience based on their unique problems and history of purchases and complaints.
2.Always-on Service − Make the service available 24/7
3.Multi-channel support − Meet the customers on their preferred channels like mobile, phone, chat etc.
4.Faster support − Managing various service needs from a single console helps in delivering support services faster.


Features:
1.Console for Service: Imagine you have a special desk with all your homework assignments neatly laid out in front of you. The console for service is like that desk, but instead of homework, it's where a customer service agent sees all the problems or questions people have and can decide which ones to work on first. This helps them give each person the attention they need.
2.Knowledge Base: Think of this like a big book filled with all the answers to questions people might ask about a product or service. Whenever someone has a problem, customer service can look up the answer quickly in this book and help them out faster.
3.Social Customer Service: Sometimes, instead of calling or emailing a company, people ask for help on social media like Facebook or Twitter. Social customer service lets companies answer these questions right there on social media, so you don't have to go to a different website to get help.
4.Live Agent: Imagine you're stuck on a tricky level in a video game and you can chat with someone who's really good at the game to help you out. Live agent is like that but for getting help with anything online. You can chat with a real person who knows a lot about whatever problem you're having and they'll help you out in real-time.
5.Mobile Platform: This is like having a special app on your phone that lets you do all your customer service stuff, like asking questions or getting help, no matter where you are. So even if you're not at home, you can still get the help you need.
6.Service Cloud Communities: Imagine you have a group of friends who all have the same video game console, and whenever someone has a problem with it, they can ask the group for help. Service cloud communities work the same way, but instead of video games, it's for people who use the same products or services. They can help each other out with tips and tricks for fixing problems without needing to talk to customer service.
```

```

## Standard Objects
```
Standard Objects − The objects already created for you by the Salesforce platform.
These are the objects which already exist in the Salesforce platform to manage the configurations and settings of the environment. Once you log in to the salesforce platform, you can see the available objects.

Example
The most commonly referred standard object is called the Account Object. It is the object which stores the preliminary information about a customer, partner, competitor or another organization.
 Settings → Setup Home → Object Manager - Account.

Important Standard Objects
In this section, we will discuss the important standard objects in Salesforce. The following table lists down the objects −

Object Name	Meaning	Usage
Account-	Represents an individual account, which is an organization or person involved in the business like customers, competitors, partners, etc.	Use this object to query and manage accounts in your organization.
Account History-	Represents the history of changes to the values in the fields of an account.	Use this object to identify changes to an account.
Case-	Represents a case, which is a customer issue or problem.	Use the case object to manage cases for your organization.
Contact-	Represents a contact, which is an individual associated with an account.	This object is used to manage individuals who are associated with an Account in the organization.
User-	Represents a user in the organization.	This object is used to query information about users and also helps to provide and modify the information concerning the users.
Asset-	Represents an item of commercial value, such as a product sold by the company or a competitor that a customer has purchased and installed.	This object is used to track assets previously sold into customer accounts. With asset tracking, a client application can quickly determine which products were previously sold or are currently installed at a specific account.
Domain-	Read-only object that represents a custom Web address assigned to a site in your organization.	This read-only object is used to object to query the domains that are associated with each website in your organization.



External Objects − The objects which you create map to the data stored outside your organization.
```
## Custom Objects
```
Custom Objects − These are the objects created by you based on your business processes. The organization’s data will always not fit into the existing standard objects. So we can extend and customize many sales force objects to meet this need. For example, a courier company can create a custom object to store the schedule and dispatch details for every week. So these objects store the data that is unique to the business. The custom objects can also have custom fields along with the standard fields available in Salesforce.

Following are the features available on Custom Objects. The features help you perform the following features −

Build page layouts to control which fields users can view and edit when entering data for the custom object record.
Import custom object records.
Create reports and dashboards to analyze custom object data.
Create a custom tab for the custom object, to display the object’s data.
Track tasks and events for custom object records.
Import custom object records.
```

##  Master Detail Relationship
```
In Salesforce, relationships between records are maintained using Relationship Fields instead of Primary and Foreign Keys like in traditional databases. Master-Detail relationship is one type of relationship where the detail records are controlled by the master record.

Key Features:
Deleting a Master Record also deletes all related detail records.
Detail records cannot exist without a corresponding Master record.
Permissions and sharing rules are inherited from the Master record to the Detail record.
Both Master and Detail records are automatically included in report record types.
In simple terms, Master-Detail relationship ensures that detail records are closely tied to their master record, and actions on the master record affect its related details consistently.
```

## Lookup Relationship
```
A Lookup relationship involves finding value of a field based on the value in another field in another object. It is mostly used in the case of commonly shared data between two objects.
```

## Schema Builder
```
The various objects and their relationships of a Salesforce application can be easily viewed using the Schema builder. And just not viewing, but we can also design, modify and implement new data models using schema builder.
Schema builder has a drag and drop interface which is used to perform all the activities. It shows all the relevant details like - field values, data types, relationship with directions etc.
Accessing Schema Builder
From Setup Home, navigate to Objects and Fields → Object Manager → Schema Builder.

# DATA SECURITY
## Control Access Organization
```
In Salesforce, data access is controlled at different levels for different users or groups. This ensures that users can only access the data they need. There are four levels of data access:

Organization Level: Controls overall access to the Salesforce platform by managing user authorization, password policies, and login restrictions.
Object Level: Sets permissions on specific objects, allowing users to view, edit, or delete records within those objects.
Fields Level: Restricts access to specific fields within objects, even if users have access to the object itself.
Records Level: Grants access to specific records within objects, allowing users to view or modify only certain records.


In Salesforce, administrators have three mechanisms to control access to the organization:

Create and Manage Users:
Administrators can create and manage users through the Admin Interface. They can add one or multiple users by providing details like name, email address, role, and profile.
Set Password Policies:
Password policies determine how passwords are managed in the organization, such as setting password expiry dates and complexity requirements. These policies are customizable and can be managed through the Security settings.
Restrict Access from IP Address:
This adds an extra layer of security by allowing access only from specific IP addresses. If a user tries to access the platform from outside the trusted IP range, additional challenge questions may be required for verification. This setting is managed through the Network Access settings.
```

##  Control Access Objects
```
In Salesforce, access to different objects is managed using profiles and permissions. Profiles define the basic permissions for a user's job role, while permission sets grant additional permissions beyond the profile.

USER PROFILES:
Profiles are created to match specific business functions, like HR or finance.
Each user is assigned only one profile.
Profiles control object access, administrative permissions, and general user permissions.

Creating a Profile:
Profiles can be created by cloning existing ones and customizing them.
Go to Setup Home → Users → Profiles to create or edit profiles.

Edit Profile:
Profiles control permissions for both standard and custom objects.
Object access can be customized using checkboxes.

Assigning a Profile:
Once created, profiles can be assigned to users.
Go to Setup Home → Users → Users and edit the user to change their profile.
In short, profiles define basic permissions for different business functions, while permission sets can grant additional permissions as needed.

PERMISSION SETS:
permission sets provide additional access to specific objects beyond what is defined in a user's profile. They extend a user's access based on their needs, such as granting access to new custom objects or providing temporary access to specific objects.

Creating a Permission Set:
Go to Setup Home → Users → Permission Sets and click on the New button to create a new permission set.

Editing Permission Set:
After creating, edit the permission set and choose Object Settings.
Customize access levels for each object as needed.
Permission sets are a flexible way to grant additional access to users without modifying their profile.

```

## Control Access Fields
```
field-level security in Salesforce allows us to control a user's access to specific fields of an object. There are two ways to set field-level access:

1. Edit a single permission set or profile: Modify the permission set or profile containing all the fields needing access restriction.
2. Edit permission on a single field for multiple profiles: Access the object through the schema builder, right-click on the specific field, and choose "Manage Field Permissions" to set permissions for multiple profiles.

For example, to grant edit access to the "DeliverySchedule" field on the "DeliveryLocations" object:

Go to the "CourierObjects" permission set.
Navigate to Object Settings, select "DeliveryLocations", and click Edit to set permissions.
Alternatively, to set field permissions for one field across all profiles:

Access the object through schema builder.
Right-click on the field, choose "Manage Field Permissions", and set permissions for multiple profiles.
```

## Control Access Records
```
Salesforce allows control over access to individual records beyond object and field restrictions. Here's a summary of how it works:

1. Record Ownership: Each record in Salesforce has an owner, and access to the record is determined by the owner's profile.
2. Restriction Mechanism: Access to records is controlled at multiple levels (object, field, and record). If there's a conflict between access levels, the more restrictive setting applies.
3. Record Sharing Mechanism:
    1.Organization-wide defaults: Set minimal access levels for all users, with customization for additional records through role hierarchies, sharing rules, and manual sharing.
    2.Types of Organization-wide Defaults: Public Read/Write, Public Read Only, Private, and Controlled by Parent.
    3. Manual Sharing: Record owners manually grant read and edit permissions to specific users or groups, a process done individually for each user profile.
```

## Create a Role Hierarchy
```
Role hierarchy in Salesforce controls data access based on users' job roles. It ensures that managers have access to records owned by their subordinates, while subordinates don't have access to their managers' records. Here's how to define a role hierarchy:

Accessing Role Hierarchy:
Go to Setup Home → Users → Roles → Setup Roles.
Defining Roles:
Add roles to the hierarchy by filling in details like role name and access level (view or edit opportunities).
Assigning Users:
Assign users to roles by selecting them from a list and adding them to the appropriate role.
By organizing roles within the hierarchy and assigning users accordingly, data access is controlled based on users' roles in the organization.
```

##  Define Sharing Rules
```
Sharing rules in Salesforce are used to grant access to specific data to users who wouldn't otherwise have access due to their roles. Here's how to create sharing rules:

Create Public Group:
 Go to Setup Home → Users → Public Groups → New Group.
 Fill in details and choose the users who need access.
 Check "Grant access using Hierarchies" for inherited access.
 Click Save.

Create Sharing Rule:
 Go to Setup Home → Security → Sharing settings.
 Choose the object (e.g., Campaigns) for which you want to create a sharing rule.
 Click New under the object's sharing rules.
 Define criteria for access (e.g., based on a field value).
 Save the sharing rule.
Now, all users in the public group will have access to the specified records based on the criteria defined in the sharing rule.
```

# Process Builder
## Automate Business Processes
```
With the Process Builder you can easily automate everything from daily tasks, like approvals and follow-up emails, to more complex processes, like order renewals and new-hire onboarding.
The Process Builder tool in Salesforce automates business processes by following these three steps:

Select an Object: Choose the object to start the process, such as "Delivery Schedule".
Add Criteria: Define conditions that allow the process to execute, like updating the delivery date.
Add Action: Specify actions to trigger when the criteria are met, such as creating a record to track delivery completion.
With Process Builder, you can automate tasks and streamline processes, like creating records when courier deliveries are completed, making operations more efficient.
```
## Importing Data
```
Salesforce provides a robust platform for data manipulation. We can Insert, View, Edit and Delete the relevant data with proper user permissions. At times, we need to add a large number of records to the respective Saleforce object in one go. Most likely these records have come from another source. The format of the incoming data has to match with the format in which the salesforce object is expecting it.

The import feature is available with CSV file structures from four sources. The sources are CSV, Outlook CSV, ACT! CSV and GMail CSV. In the example given below, we will use the normal csv file for importing data to the Salesforce platform.

1. Navigate to Data Import Wizard:
   Go to Setup Home → Data → Data Import Wizard.
   Launch the wizard and choose the object (e.g., Accounts and Contacts) to which you want to import data.
2. Choose File and Options:
   Select the CSV file containing the data.
   Choose to add new records, update existing ones, or both.
   Specify fields for matching existing records.
3. Map Field Names:
   Match incoming field names with Salesforce field names.
   Complete mapping and start the import.
```

## Exporting Data
```
You can choose the objects from which data needs to be exported and also schedule a regular export form those objects. There is also a filtering option on how much data to export based on the age of the record.
exporting data from Salesforce involves these steps:

1. Navigate to Data Export:
   Go to Setup Home → Data → Data Export.
   Schedule an export by specifying frequency, start and end dates.
2. Choose Salesforce Objects:
   Select the Salesforce objects whose data you want to export by checking the corresponding checkboxes.
3. Wait for Data Export:
   After selecting objects, wait for the exported data to be ready for download.
   Download links will appear once the export is complete, or a download link will be sent to the specified email address.
```

## Reports
```
Creating reports in Salesforce is not a very complicated process. The reports are created on top of one or more Salesforce objects. It has the flexibility of applying filters and joining data sets to create sophisticated reports. The interface is called the Report builder.
Creating reports in Salesforce involves these steps:

Access Report Builder:
Go to the Reports icon in the left sidebar of the Lightning Experience Home Page.
Click on "Create New Report".
Choose Report Object:
Select the Salesforce object(s) on which the report will be based, such as "Accounts".
Define Report Settings:
Choose display options like "My Accounts" to show records owned by the report creator.
Set filters, such as date ranges or specific field values.
Apply Filters:
Add filters to refine the report data, such as filtering by state or province.
```

## Dashboards
```
Dashboards provide more insights than reports as they combine the data from many reports and show a summarized result. Looking at many reports at a time gives the flexibility of combining the results from them quickly. Also summaries in dashboards help us decide on action plans quicker. The dashboards can contain charts, graphs and Tabular data.
Creating a dashboard in Salesforce involves these steps:

1. Access Dashboard Builder:
   Click on the Dashboard button on the left menu bar in the Salesforce Home Page.
   Select "New Dashboard" and provide a name and description.
2. Add Components:
   Choose the reports or data sets to include in the dashboard.
   Select the type of component, such as charts or graphs, for each report.
3. Customize Layout:
   Arrange the components on the dashboard layout as desired.
   Resize components for better visibility and organization.
```

## Using Formula Fields
```
Let's consider a scenario in a company's Salesforce CRM where they manage sales opportunities. Each opportunity has a "Deal Amount" field representing the potential value of the deal. Now, the company wants to calculate a commission amount based on the deal amount, but they also want to apply different commission rates depending on certain conditions.

For example:

If the deal amount is less than $10,000, the commission rate is 5%.
If the deal amount is between $10,000 and $50,000, the commission rate is 7%.
If the deal amount is greater than $50,000, the commission rate is 10%.
To achieve this, they can create a formula field called "Commission Amount" on the Opportunity object. This formula field will calculate the commission based on the deal amount and the specified conditions.

we're creating a formula field in the Contact object to display the Account Number associated with each contact.

Step 1:
Navigate to Setup Home → Object Manager → Contact.
Scroll down to the Fields and Relationships tab and click New.
Choose Formula as the data type and click Next.
Choose the return type as Text and fill in the Field Name and Field Label.

Step 2:
Click Next to proceed to the next window.
Select the Account Number field from the Account object.
Click Insert to insert this field into the formula.

Step 3:
Review the formula field configuration and click Save.
This formula field will now display the Account Number associated with each contact based on the relationship between Contact and Account objects.
```

# VISUALFORCE
## Visualforce Pages
```
Visualforce pages are like webpages within Salesforce, created using a special markup language. They're used to access, display, and update data within the organization. Each tag corresponds to a user interface component, like a page section or a field.
Let's say you're a sales manager at a company that uses Salesforce to track leads, contacts, and opportunities. You want to create a custom webpage within Salesforce to display important sales data in a visually appealing way.

To create a Visualforce page:
Navigate to developer console → File → New → Visualforce page.
Name the page (e.g., HelloworldPage) and write the code.
Save the page and click Preview to see the result.

To add components:
Use tags to add components like blocks and sections to the page.
Edit the code accordingly and preview the changes.
Preferences can be set for easier navigation:

Go to Help → Preferences to access various settings.
```

## Variables and Formulas
```
The data from the Salesforce objects can be brought into the Visualforce page using variables and expressions. Like other normal programming language, the Visualforce language has expressions, operators and literals, etc. The basic building block of this language is expressions.

The syntax of a Visualforce expression is as below.

{! expression }
Example:
Let us use the global variable $user. We can write the following code to get the username, First name and login name.
<apex:page>

    <h2>Welcome, {! $User.FirstName }!</h2>

    <p>Your username is: {! $User.Username }</p>

    <p>Your organization name is: {! $Organization.Name }</p>

    <p>The current date and time is: {! NOW() }</p>

    <p>Your age is: {! YEAR(TODAY()) - YEAR($User.Birthdate) }</p>

</apex:page>
```

## Standard Controllers
```
Visualforce follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, where controllers interact with the database to retrieve and manipulate data, and the view (the Visualforce page) presents the data to the user. Here's how it works:

Model: The model represents the data and business logic of the application. In Visualforce, the model typically consists of Salesforce objects and their corresponding fields.
View: The view is the user interface that displays the data to the user. In Visualforce, the view is created using Visualforce markup language to design the layout and structure of the webpage.
Controller: The controller is responsible for handling user input, processing requests, and interacting with the database. In Visualforce, controllers are Apex classes that contain the logic for retrieving and manipulating data.
To display specific records or groups of records on a Visualforce page, you typically need the record ID(s). In integrated scenarios where Visualforce pages are connected to other Salesforce components, such as standard or custom controllers, the record ID can be passed automatically.

However, in standalone Visualforce pages, you may need to manually specify the record ID to view the data. This can be done by passing the record ID as a parameter in the URL or by using Apex code to query for the record(s) based on certain criteria.

For example, if you want to display details of a specific account with ID "001XXXXXXXXXXXX", you could create a Visualforce page with a controller that queries for that account:
```

## Records, Fields and Tables
```
We have already seen how to get the values of a record using the standard controller. But we can also display the field values in a more formatted way by using additional controllers.
we will see how to display the fields of an object and the data of a details table in a Master-detail relation.

Display Fields
When we want to display the fields of a record in a formatted manner with column headers, rather than just the labels and values, we can use the OutputField option. The code given below shows the apex program to display the filled data from Contact. As you can see, we do not need the labels to be in place to indicate the field values.

Display Tables
We can display all the records of a details table by taking a value from a master table. For example, we can display all the contacts associated with an account. In such case, we use the iteration component which in our case is the contacts table linked to account. Below is the code to display all the contacts associated with the Account table.
````

## Using Forms
```
In Salesforce, creating input forms for viewing and editing data is essential, and Visualforce pages allow us to accomplish this. Let's break down the steps to create a basic input form and then enhance it for better alignment and readability:

Creating Basic Input Form:
Open Visualforce Page: Navigate to Developer Console → File → New → Visualforce Page.
Write Code: Write the Visualforce code to create a basic input form. Here's an example using Contact as the standard controller for editing Name, Email, and Phone fields:

<apex:page standardController="Contact">
    <apex:form>
        <apex:pageBlock title="Edit Contact">
            <apex:pageBlockSection>
                <apex:inputField value="{!Contact.Name}"/>
                <apex:inputField value="{!Contact.Email}"/>
                <apex:inputField value="{!Contact.Phone}"/>
            </apex:pageBlockSection>
            <apex:pageBlockButtons>
                <apex:commandButton action="{!save}" value="Save"/>
            </apex:pageBlockButtons>
        </apex:pageBlock>
    </apex:form>
</apex:page>
Result: Upon running the code, you'll see a form with fields aligned in multiple columns.

Enhancing Form Alignment:
To improve readability and alignment, you can modify the Visualforce code to place all fields in a single column within a section block:

<apex:page standardController="Contact">
    <apex:form>
        <apex:pageBlock title="Edit Contact">
            <apex:pageBlockSection>
                <apex:pageBlockSectionItem>
                    <apex:outputLabel value="Name"/>
                    <apex:inputField value="{!Contact.Name}"/>
                </apex:pageBlockSectionItem>
                <apex:pageBlockSectionItem>
                    <apex:outputLabel value="Email"/>
                    <apex:inputField value="{!Contact.Email}"/>
                </apex:pageBlockSectionItem>
                <apex:pageBlockSectionItem>
                    <apex:outputLabel value="Phone"/>
                    <apex:inputField value="{!Contact.Phone}"/>
                </apex:pageBlockSectionItem>
            </apex:pageBlockSection>
            <apex:pageBlockButtons>
                <apex:commandButton action="{!save}" value="Save"/>
            </apex:pageBlockButtons>
        </apex:pageBlock>
    </apex:form>
</apex:page>
Result:
Upon running this modified code, you'll see the fields aligned in a single column, improving the form's readability and aesthetics.

These steps demonstrate how to create and enhance input forms using Visualforce in Salesforce.

## what is Visualforce?
```
Visualforce is a markup language used in Salesforce for building custom user interfaces. It allows developers to create web pages with dynamic content and interactions tailored to specific business needs. Here's a concise example:

<apex:page standardController="Account">
    <apex:form>
        <apex:pageBlock title="Account Details">
            <apex:pageBlockSection>
                <apex:outputField value="{!Account.Name}"/>
                <apex:outputField value="{!Account.Industry}"/>
                <apex:outputField value="{!Account.Type}"/>
            </apex:pageBlockSection>
        </apex:pageBlock>
    </apex:form>
</apex:page>
In this example:

<apex:page> defines a Visualforce page.
standardController="Account" specifies that this page is associated with the Account standard controller.
<apex:form> encloses the form elements.
<apex:pageBlock> creates a section with a title.
<apex:pageBlockSection> organizes fields within the page block.
<apex:outputField> displays fields from the Account object, such as Name, Industry, and Type.
When this Visualforce page is viewed in Salesforce, it will render an interface showing the Account details with the specified fields.
```

## List Controllers
```
At times, we need to view a given set of records from a Salesforce object by applying filter criteria. This is achieved by using list controllers which allow you to create Visualforce pages that can display or act on a set of records. The standard list controllers can be used in the following set of objects.

Account
Asset
Campaign
Case
Contact
Contract
Idea
Lead
Opportunity
Order
Solution
User
Custom objects
Example
We take the example of contact object. We fetch the records from this object and display it using list controllers. To achieve this, we create an apex page with the following code. The code creates a pageblock with column values matching the column names of the contact object.

```

## Static Resources
```
The user interface in a Visualforce base can display dynamic content the value of which keeps changing based on user responses. But there are times when we need some content which should not change with the change in values of other components in the page. For example, an image file may be required to remain constant. Such content which cannot be changed in a page is known as a static resource.

Following are a few static resources in Salesforce −

Images
Javascript Files
Flash files
CSS files

Steps to create static resource:
 1.Create a Static Resource Container:
 Navigate to Develop → Static Resources.
 Specify a name, description, and file location for the static resource.
 2.Upload a Static Resource:
 Save the settings to attach the file to the User Interface controller.
 3.Reference the Static Resource:
 Write Apex code to reference the static object created above.
```
