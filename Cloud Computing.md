# Cloud Computing
```
Cloud computing is accessing services over the internet instead of on your computer. Everyone uses it, from individuals with smartphones to businesses of all sizes. It works by storing data and applications on servers in data centers, which users access via the internet. This eliminates the need for companies to manage their own costly infrastructure, as they can simply subscribe to cloud services and access the resources they need. It's like renting a car: users get to use it, while the provider handles maintenance and upgrades.

Flexibility: Employees can work securely from anywhere, enhancing productivity and collaboration.
Cost-effectiveness: Shared resources reduce costs, with expenses often categorized as operational rather than capital.

## How cloud computing security protects your company?
```
Cloud computing enhances company security in several ways:

Expertise and Updates: Top cloud vendors employ cybersecurity experts who regularly update security protocols to safeguard users from cyber threats. This relieves organizations of the burden of maintaining their own security infrastructure.
Regulatory Compliance: Cloud service providers ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, saving companies the effort of assembling dedicated compliance teams and keeping up with evolving regulations.
Redundancy: Cloud platforms not only store data but also provide redundancy by backing it up. This ensures that data is protected even in the event of power outages or other disruptions.
Analogous to Banking Security: Cloud security can be likened to the security of a bank, where data is safer than on unsecured networks. Top cloud vendors, like Salesforce, offer robust security measures, making them trusted choices for large companies.
By leveraging cloud computing, companies can benefit from enhanced security without the need for extensive internal cybersecurity resources.
